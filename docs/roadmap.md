# 🚀 Roadmap - Decorators

This roadmap focuses on the **implementation of decorators**.  

Progress is tracked with status icons:

- 🔴 Pending  
- 🟡 In Progress  
- 🟢 Done  

---

## 📊 Phase 1: Observability & Telemetry

🎯 Goal: Provide insights and monitoring into runtime behavior.

- 🟡 **Telemetry** → collect metrics and usage data  
- 🔴 **Performance Monitoring** → track execution time and bottlenecks  

---

## 🔧 Phase 2: Core Decorators (Fundamental Utilities)

🎯 Goal: Build the essential decorators first, as they will be used by many others.

- 🔴 **Memoization / Cache** → cache expensive computations  
- 🔴 **Logging / Tracing** → automatic logs for debugging  
- 🔴 **Validation** → input/output schema validation  

---

## ⚙️ Phase 3: Application-Oriented Decorators

🎯 Goal: Add decorators that improve development workflow and app control.

- 🔴 **Workers** → run background tasks  
- 🔴 **Dependency Injection** → manage modular dependencies  
- 🔴 **Feature Flags** → toggle features dynamically  

---

## 🔐 Phase 4: Reliability & Protection

🎯 Goal: Introduce mechanisms for stability and software protection.

- 🔴 **Retry / Circuit Breaker** → gracefully handle transient errors  
- 🔴 **Rate Limiting / Throttling** → control execution frequency  
- 🔴 **License Check** → license validation helper(inspired by Denuvo... in a good way!)  

---

## 🌍 Phase 5: Cross-Platform Support

🎯 Goal: Ensure compatibility across JavaScript runtimes.

- 🔴 **Node.js**  
- 🔴 **Deno**  
- 🔴 **Bun**
